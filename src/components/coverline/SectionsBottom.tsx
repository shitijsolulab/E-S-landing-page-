          <p>
            Every surplus lines placement needs one, in the form the filing state requires,
            with declination evidence that holds up. It recurs on every account, the
            requirements differ state by state, and the person assembling it is usually
            reconstructing carrier responses from an inbox weeks after the fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coverline builds it from evidence it already holds. Every carrier your broker
            approached, every declination and the reason given, every date — already logged
            against the placement record as it happened, not reconstructed afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coverline does not make a legal determination that a diligent search has been
            satisfied. That judgment stays with your licensed broker, as it must. What
            Coverline does is make sure the evidence is there when your broker makes it.

Every ranking is those rules applied to the submission, not a model guessing at similarity."],
      ["What does a 94% appetite fit actually mean?", "It's a rules-based score measuring how closely the risk matches that carrier's configured appetite. It is not a probability of quote — Coverline tells you where the risk belongs, not what the carrier will do with it."],

      ["Does Coverline support surplus lines compliance?", "Coverline determines the diligent search requirements applicable per state, captures declination evidence from your actual carrier responses, and generates the supporting documentation. It does not make a legal determination that a diligent search has been satisfied — that judgment stays with your licensed broker."],
