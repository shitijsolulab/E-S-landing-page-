          Appetite fit is a rules-based score measuring how closely the risk matches that
          carrier's configured appetite — class, territory, size, capacity and loss
          history. It is not a probability of quote. Whether a carrier quotes depends on
          their underwriter, their capacity that week, and the market. Coverline tells you
          where the risk belongs, not what the carrier will do with it.

            tighten on a Tuesday and tell the market on a Friday. Your panel is only as
            current as what you and your account team put into it. That's why every
            override is logged, and why Carrier Appetite Intelligence aggregates your own
            declination reasons and quote patterns to surface evidenced shifts — but a
            profile no one has updated is a profile that will be wrong eventually.

            Appetite Intelligence needs your own placement history to work from. It
            surfaces a shift when your evidence supports one, not on day one. Expect it to
            be quiet for the first few months. That's the design.

          Coverline's ranking draws only on the extracted, cited data and the appetite
          rules you configured. It does not use outside knowledge about the risk, the
          insured, or what a carrier "usually" does. If a claim can't be traced to a source
          document or a rule you set, it doesn't appear in the market plan.
